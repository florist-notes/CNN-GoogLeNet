2014 [ILSVRC](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) ([ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) <b>Winner</b>.

It is a benchmark competition where teams across the world compete to classify, localize, detect ... images of 1000 categories, taken from the imagenet dataset.The imagenet dataset holds 15M images of 22K categories but for this contest: 1.2M images in 1K categories were chosen.Their goal was, Classification i.e, make 5 guesses about label for an image.Team " GoogLeNet ", achieved top 5 test error rate of 6.7%. It was a better than any other models performance at time. Check ILSVRC 2014 [results](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/results).

This paper is important as it stands as a stepping stone for CNNs in Computer Vision community. It was record breaking, new and exciting.
